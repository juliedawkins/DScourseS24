\section{Introduction}
For my research project, at the moment I am interested in exploring if college towns like Norman, which have a student housing market that affects the pricing and availability of housing to non-students who live in the town, experience higher rates of homelessness than towns of similar sizes (and ideally similar rent prices to isolate the effect of just having higher rent prices) that do not center around a university.

There are lots of sources I could scrape, though figuring out the data that is the easiest form to scrape (e.g.,, a table if I'm scraping it through a selector) will be a challenge. Some that come to mind are the Housing and Urban Development website (which has Point-in-Time counts, the annual count of homeless individuals) and the US Census which will hopefully contain information on median rent, income, et cetera. I have used an API with American Community Survey data before so I believe it should not be challenging to access this data. 

(Due to challenges with Question 6 in this homework, I will not be answering the additional questions in this document.)
