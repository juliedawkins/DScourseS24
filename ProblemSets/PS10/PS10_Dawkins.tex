\section{Question 9}

I have created a table showing the results of each of the tribes of learning. (Note that SVM, support vector machine, is absent; I could not get the code to run, but the code is still in my R file.)

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \caption{Model Performance Metrics}
  \begin{tabular}[t]{llllllll}
    \toprule
    penalty & .estimate & alg & cost complexity & tree depth & min n & hidden units & neighbors\\\\
    \midrule
    0.00 & 0.853 & logit & & & & & \\\\
    & 0.868 & tree model & 0.00 & 15.00 & 20.00 & & \\\\
    0.00 & 0.838 & neural net & & & & 10.00 & \\\\
    & 0.844 & k nearest neighbors & & & & & 28.00\\\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

We can see that the estimate is all in the .8s for each model, but the logit and the tree model perform the best. The tree model has a roughly 0.87 (87\%) accuracy rate and was my highest, followed by the logist at approximately 85\% accuracy. Neural net and k nearest neighbors performed the worst for me, hovering around 84\%.
